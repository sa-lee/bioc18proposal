# Workshop Description

In this workshop, we will give an overview of how to perform low-level
analyses of genomic data using the  grammar of genomic data transformation
defined in the plyranges package. We will cover:

- introduction to GRanges
- overview of the core verbs for arithmetic, restriction, and aggregation of GRanges objects
- performing joins between GRanges objects
- using the above to perform coverage analysis

The workshop will be a computer lab, in which the participants will be able to 
ask questions and interact with the instructors.

## Pre-requisites

This workshop is mostly self-contained however familiarity with the following would be useful:

- plyranges [vignette](https://sa-lee.github.io/plyranges/articles/an-introduction.html)
- the GenomicRanges and IRanges packages
- tidyverse approaches to data analysis

 
## Workshop Participation

Students will work through an Rmarkdown document while the instructors respond to any questions they have.

## _R_ / _Bioconductor_ packages used

- plyranges
- HelloRanges
